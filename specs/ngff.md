# NGFF data in MoBIE

Several MoBIE projects use the OME-ZARR / [OME-NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/) file format to store their image data.
This data format can be imaged by several other image viewers and visualization programs:
- napari
- vizarr
- neuroglancer
- and more

You can for example open the full EM data of a *P. dumerilii* larva in these tools from: https://s3.embl.de/i2k-2020/platy-raw.ome.zarr.
